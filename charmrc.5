.SH NAME
charmrc \- Configuration file for Charm

.SH DESCRIPTION

A charmrc file is a configuration file for Charm, a client for LiveJournal
and other blogging sites which support the LiveJournal protocol. It is
a text file.

A charmrc file can include other charmrc files, with the following:
.PP
    include FILENAME
.PP
Files are read in the order that they are specified. When that directive
is used, processing of the current configuration file is stopped, the
included configuration file is read and processed, and then processing
on the current configuration file is resumed.

An active line in a charmrc file will have the format:
.PP
    name = value
.PP
Blank lines are ignored. Lines that begin with a pound-sign (#) are
comments, and are ignored. Leading spaces and tabs are ignored. 

All boolean options can be on ("on", "yes", "y", "true", "t", "1" all work)
or off ("off", "no", "n", "false", "f", "0").

Almost all options can be overridden interactively. Most things set in
the configuration file are merely treated as a default.

.SH LOGIN CONFIGURATION

.TP
.B login = username password [ site ]
Specifies a journal user for a LiveJournal-based site. The site is an
optional hostname, such as
.I www.livejournal.com

.TP
.B hlogin = username MD5password [ site ]
Like 
.B login
except the password specified is an MD5 hash digest of the actual password.

.TP
.B atomblog = username password [ URIpath ]
Specifies a journal user for an Atom API-based site. The URIpath is an
optional URL for feed discovery, such as
.I https://www.blogger.com/atom/

.TP
.B hatomblog = username MD5password [ URIpath ]
Like 
.B atomblog
except the password specified is an MD5 hash digest of the actual password.

.TP
.B metaweb = username password URIpath
Specifies a journal user for a MetaWeb API-based site. The URIpath is the
URL for the site's XML-RPC MetaWeb interface, such as 
.I http://testuser.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php

.TP
.B default_user = username
Because
.B login
and 
.B hlogin
and
.B atomblog
and
.B hatomblog
and
.B metaweb
may be specified multiple times, this parameter allows the user to specify
which identity to use by default.

.TP 
.B journal = journalname
By default, Charm uses the journal of the current user. However, some people
post to a community or a shared journal more frequently than they do to their
own journal. This option allows the user to specify that journal by default,
rather than their own.

.TP
.B url = interface_url
By default, Charm posts to LiveJournal. This parameter can be used to
specify a different default, rather than specifying the site in
.B login
or
.B hlogin
(but this must be a full URL, not just the hostname).

.SH FRIENDS-CHECKING CONFIGURATION

.TP
.B checkdelay = minutes
Specifies the number of minutes to wait between each attempt to check
whether friends have posted journal updates.

.TP
.B checkgroups = groups
Specifies the friend groups to check. This is a comma-delimited list,
such as "Group1,Group2,Group3".

.SH GENERAL ARCHIVAL CONFIGURATION

.TP
.B archive_dir = directory
Specifies the directory to save completed posts in.

.TP
.B organize = type
Specifies how to organize the archive directory. 
.I type
can be
.B none
(no subdirectories),
.B year
(subdirectories by year), or
.B month
(subdirectories by month within subdirectories by year).
